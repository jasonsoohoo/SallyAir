# SallyAir

SallyAir is a FRC competition robot for the Steamworks season. Developed in Java and built on a National Instruments roborio the robot is capable of interfacing
with dc motor controllers, limit switches, sharp sensors, servos, pnumatic solenoids and a retroreflective based robot vision camera. Some of the mechanical systems
programmed include a gearbox skid-steer drive train, and a lazy susan style turret with a large bore hole that uses robot vision to automatically align with a target
utilizing proportional error correction and a "hood" that changes position to alter trajectory of a fired projectile.
